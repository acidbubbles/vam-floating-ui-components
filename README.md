# Virt-A-Mate Plugin Template for VSCode

What you will need:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit your plugins
- [Virt-A-Mate](https://www.patreon.com/meshedvr/) to use your plugins

How to use this template:

1. Decide on a plugin name. Here we will call it `MySuperPlugin`
2. Download this repo: https://github.com/acidbubbles/vam-plugin-template/archive/master.zip
3. Rename `MyPlugin.csproj` to `MySuperPlugin.csproj` and `MyPlugin.cs` to `MySuperPlugin.cs`
4. Open `MySuperPlugin.csproj` and change `<Compile Include="MyPlugin.cs" />` to `<Compile Include="MySuperPlugin.cs" />`
5. Open `MySuperPlugin.cs` and start coding!
6. Remove those instructions from this `README.md` file and explain what it does, and how to use it. You can also change the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file to put your name (it's all right, you have my blessing!)
